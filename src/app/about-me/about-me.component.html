            <p style="font-size: 15px;">
                From a young age, I exhibited a keen interest in computers that set me on a 
                path of technological exploration. Growing up, I was the go-to person in my 
                family and circle of friends for troubleshooting computer issues. My fascination 
                with the inner workings of these machines was evident as I eagerly delved into 
                programming and coding, teaching myself the basics of various programming languages.

                As I entered college, my passion for computers and software development only 
                intensified. I pursued a degree in computer science and found myself immersed 
                in a world of algorithms, data structures, and software engineering. The process of 
                creating software, whether it was a simple program or a complex application, became 
                a source of joy and fulfillment.

            <p style="font-size: 15px;">
                My experiences in college not only solidified my love for software development 
                but also opened doors to exciting opportunities, and collaborations with like-minded 
                individuals who shared the passion for technology. With each line of code I wrote,
                I knew I was forging a path towards a promising career in the world of software 
                development, where my childhood fascination had grown into a professional calling.
